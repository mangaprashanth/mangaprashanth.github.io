## 💻 Featured Project: Q/A Classroom Assistant Chatbot  

This project documents the creation of an **AI-powered classroom assistant** built using the **Mizou platform**.  
The chatbot provides accurate, syllabus-based responses to student questions without relying on external sources — aligning with ethical AI and user-centric design principles.

**Key Highlights:**
- Built using structured **Design Thinking** (Empathy → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test).  
- Enforced strict “materials-only” rule to ensure academic accuracy.  
- Included empathy-driven rules for clarity, tone, and responsible AI behavior.  
- Tested across multiple scenarios (factual, ambiguous, integrity, and hallucination stress tests).  
- Designed as an educational aid that guides rather than provides direct answers.  

📘 **Documentation Summary:** The chatbot follows a closed-domain retrieval policy, guiding students using only course materials such as *Introduction to Machine Learning with Python*. It integrates ethical AI principles, provides clear instructions, and ensures transparency in responses.
