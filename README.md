## 💡 Featured Projects  

### 🧩 1. Q/A Classroom Assistant Chatbot  

**Overview:**  
An **AI-powered educational chatbot** designed using the **Mizou platform** to provide syllabus-based Q&A assistance for students — focusing on clarity, empathy, and ethics.

**Challenges:**  
Balancing technical precision with user-friendly explanations while preventing model hallucinations.

**Solutions:**  
- Adopted the **Design Thinking process** (Empathize → Define → Ideate → Prototype → Test).  
- Built a closed-domain retrieval policy using structured course materials.  
- Integrated empathy-driven interaction guidelines.  

**Results:**  
- Improved clarity and trust in chatbot responses.  
- Achieved high accuracy in academic Q&A sessions.  

📘 **Documentation:**  
Follows a “materials-only” design rule based on *Introduction to Machine Learning with Python*.

### 🤖 2. Machine Learning vs Deep Learning  

**Overview:**  
A conceptual and visual representation highlighting the **key distinctions between Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL)**.

**Challenges:**  
Presenting complex AI differences simply and visually for non-technical audiences.

**Solutions:**  
- Designed an infographic comparing the workflows, algorithms, and learning styles.  
- Used relatable examples (spam detection vs image recognition).  
- Simplified the contrast through color-coded visual storytelling.  

🖼️ **Visual Comparison:**  
![ML vs DL Comparison] (ML vs DL.png)  
*Human-designed illustration comparing Machine Learning and Deep Learning.*

📄 **Summary:**  
| Aspect | Machine Learning | Deep Learning |
|:--------|:-----------------|:--------------|
| **Definition** | Algorithms learn from data using manual feature extraction. | Neural networks learn hierarchical representations automatically. |
| **Feature Engineering** | Manual | Automatic |
| **Data Requirement** | Moderate | High |
| **Complexity** | Shallow Models | Multi-layer Neural Networks |
| **Example Use Case** | Spam Detection | Image Recognition |

**Key Takeaway:**  
➡️ Deep Learning is a **subset of Machine Learning**, differing primarily in how it learns and represents data.

### 3. Adapting to Challenges – Leadership Reflection Artifact

**Overview:**  
A reflective leadership piece inspired by the stories of **Moses** and **Esther**, focusing on how biblical principles can guide adaptive leadership in modern contexts—especially during periods of uncertainty and technological transition.  [oai_citation:0‡Adapting to Challenges.docx](sediment://file_0000000006ac71f5990b3b2b761806f6)

**Challenges:**  
- Leading a team through rapid organizational and technological changes driven by **AI and machine learning**, while addressing mixed emotions—enthusiasm from some and anxiety from others.  
- Facing a high-stakes decision about transitioning a major workflow to an **AI-led model**, with unclear outcomes and significant risk.

**Solutions:**  
- Drawing from **Moses’ example**, adopted a leadership posture centered on humility, seeking God’s wisdom, listening attentively, and embracing preparedness even when feeling unqualified.  
- Following **Esther’s strategic approach**, applied careful planning, gathered data, consulted key stakeholders, prayed for clarity, and made decisions with courage rather than avoidance.  
- Integrated both spiritual insight and practical leadership strategies to navigate uncertainty with confidence.

**Summary:**  
This artifact demonstrates how timeless biblical leadership lessons can shape effective decision-making today. By combining humility, courage, spiritual discernment, and strategic thinking, I developed a grounded framework for leading teams through change and approaching difficult choices with confidence and integrity.
